# Dicee-Game

This is a project made during the Udemy course The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp, to get used to Javascript, CSS, and HTML, using the dices to play a lucky,
when the page is refreshed, the dices get random numbers, and the page tells you if player one or player two wins.

The JS file gets a random number using Math.random, and this number is used to get one of the 6 dices images for each side, where it shows if there's a winner or a draw.

Hope you enjoy it, and fell free to make any changes!
