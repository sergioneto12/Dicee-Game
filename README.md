# Have Fun!

This site was (maybe, still is!) part of one starting project from Full Stack Web Development lessons I've learned.

The ideia is pretty simple: 

- Refresh the page.
- Each time you do that, a diferent result is going to appear.
- Have fun betting with friends, and try it yourself! Get a new style, maybe!

It's completely made in JS, HTML and CSS, with the behavior being entirely done wih JS!
